 The purpose of this program is to automate the identification, killing, and harvesting of dragons in Old School Runescape.
 
 Dragons are identified using a basic Alexnet model trained to detect dragons. Direct mouse inputs are used to click and harvest the dragons, to heal the agent, and to remove the agent from combat.
 
 Health levels of both the dragons being engaged, and the agent are monitored using pixel levels of certain screen regions within the game. When the agents health reaches a certain point, food will be consumed to prevent it from dying.
